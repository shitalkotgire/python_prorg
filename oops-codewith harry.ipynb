    "#Static Methods In Python \n",
    "''' Static methods in Python are extremely similar to python class methods,\n",
    "but the difference is that a static method is bound to a class rather than the objects for that class.\n",
    "To define a static method, we use @staticmethod decorator, which is a built-in decorator. \n",
    "Also, there is no need to import any module to use decorators. \n",
    "Using a static method in a class, we permit it to be accessed only by the class objects or inside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few limitations related to static methods, such as:\n",
    "Unlike, class method a static method cannot alter or change any variable value or state of the class.\n",
    "Static methods do not have any knowledge related to class\n",
    "However, we prefer the static method, at places where it could work to make our program more efficient \n",
    "and faster as we do not have to pass self as a parameter, so the efficiency of the program increases.\n",
    "Static methods have a very clear use-case. When we need some functionality not for an Object but with the complete class,\n",
    "we make a method static. This is advantageous when we need to create utility methods.\n",
    "Finally, note that in a static method, we do not need the self or cls to be passed as the first argument.\n",
